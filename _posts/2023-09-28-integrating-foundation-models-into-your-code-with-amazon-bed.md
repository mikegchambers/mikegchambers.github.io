Amazon Bedrock makes it easy to be able to integrate Foundation models into your code and that's exactly what we're going to have a look at in this video hello my name is Mike Chambers and I'm a developer advocate for Amazon web services working as a specialist in generative AI so let's just jump into some code and see how we can make it work with Amazon Bedrock here inside a visual studio code I'm running a Jupiter notebook and of course you don't have to run your code in a notebook and it doesn't have to be python but those are the choices that I've made for this video so the first thing that I do in this notebook is to import the boat O3 library and also I'm going to import Json as well so we're going to use that later on when we're making some generation and the next thing that I do well this is the important thing creating the Bedrock client in Bodo 3.
