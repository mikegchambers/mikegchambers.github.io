hello let's build an application that uses generative AI in fact let's build that application using generative Ai and do the whole thing without writing any code whatsoever sounds like a tall order but in this video I'm going to show you Amazon Party Rock which is a Hands-On environment that you can use completely for free to experiment with generative AI build your own generative AI powered applications and learn really important skills like prompt engineering along the way let's jump in to Amazon party rock and this is what it looks like so to get started it couldn't be simpler all you need to do is describe the application that you'd like to build so let's click on build your own application and we can type in whatever we want and I'm going to enter into here what is my pets superhero name that is the application that I want to build an application that can help me me with just this so let's go ahead and click create app and what's happening now is that party rock is taking this text which is a prompt and it's deciding how it can build an application for us that can help us to choose our pet superhero name and once it's built that it'll show us all of the widgets that it's made
