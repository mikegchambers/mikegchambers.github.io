so we were doing this app that was using generative Ai and it was not working very well it's not very accurate it so it was hallucinating yes exactly so we're going to show you how we managed to fix this problem and you're going to explain how it works behind the scenes I will try yeah my name is Tiffany and my name is Mike so Tiffany can you tell us a little bit more about this application that you were developing yes so uh the app is basically an app to um you you give your persona basically if you're a developer if you're a soltion architect or whatever profile you have and you talk about the different uh Technologies you want to use basically if you use like let's say python Java and what do you want to learn on AWS services like let's say you want to learn more about containers and and what the app is doing uh at least the idea was that uh the app would give you um a learning path of the things that you need to search for in order to you know like what would be interesting for you to learn on AWS basically absolutely so I can go to this app I can tap buttons and say I'm a python developer and I don't care about anything else and and then and hopefully it can help me to figure
