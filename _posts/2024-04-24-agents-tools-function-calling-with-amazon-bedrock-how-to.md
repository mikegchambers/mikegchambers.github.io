Generative AI is an amazing technology, but there are some things that it just can't do. Ask a large language model what the time is. It won't know. Ask a large language model to perform some complex mathematics. It won't be able to do that either. Although it might pretend to be able to do it and in some cases it actually can. And in some cases, it just fails miserably. So, how can we solve this problem? How can we give a large language model access to the tools that it needs to be able to solve that kind of problem?
