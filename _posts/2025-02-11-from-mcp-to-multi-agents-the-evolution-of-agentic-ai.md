I joined the AWS Developers Podcast for a conversation about where agentic AI is heading. We covered a lot of ground in just over an hour — from the evolution of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and its real-world challenges, to why lightweight agent frameworks like Strands are gaining traction, to the security concerns that come with giving agents access to your filesystem and command line.

We also talked about AI coding assistants as arguably the biggest success story in the agent space so far, context overloading as a practical bottleneck, and why 2025 is shaping up to be "the year of agents."
