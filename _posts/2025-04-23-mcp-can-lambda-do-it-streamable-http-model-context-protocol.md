Hi, welcome to the context where we talk about MCB. And this week I really want to show you Tiffany a project that I've been working on where we can create MCP servers with just a few lines of [Music] code. So model context protocol um MCP it's it's all the rage. Everybody wants to talk about it in relation to large language models and generative AI. Just quickly just to sort of talk about what this is. It's a protocol. That's what the P stands for.
