If you're like me, you like building agents and you have to put lots of instructions together to get the agents to perform all of the tasks they need to do. That can get pretty complex. Yeah. Except Mike, there's a recent wave of models that are just way better at managing their own orchestration at reasoning through a goal you put in front of them, leveraging tools to enable them to do things that the base model can't do alone. I you you really don't have to do all of that work anymore. So you're telling me that I don't need to write lots of complex instructions.
