Strands agents SDK is one of a new generation of agentic frameworks. In this video, we're going to get ourselves an introduction and see how we can get started. But before we do, let's just remind ourselves what agents are. An agent is just a piece of code. And without an LLM, it can't do very much. So, let's add in a large language model. This gives our agent the capability of being able to understand natural language. So it can start to do things. I guess this becomes a chatbot. So to give it agency and an ability to affect change in the outside world, we're going to connect it with some tools.
