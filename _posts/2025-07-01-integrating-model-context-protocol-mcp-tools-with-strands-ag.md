Hello, welcome back to this series on Strand's agents. In the previous videos, which you'll find linked in the description below, we've been introduced to how to get started and we've also taken a deep dive into tools. In this video, we're going to take a look at MCP. That's model context protocol. It's all the rage. It's how people are building agentic systems today. Now, if you're not familiar with MCP, there is a link in the description below to a video that I put together which introduces the concept. But in this video, it's all about strands. Strands agents.
