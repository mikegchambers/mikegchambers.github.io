In the last video, we got introduced to Strand's agents SDK and we saw how we can use it to build a new type of agent workflow. If you've not seen that video, then check the description below. In this video, we're going to go deeper dive into tools. Let's remind ourselves of the architecture. So, we have Strand's agents, which is the core of our application. We link it to a large language model, and of course, to make it useful, we link it in with tools. In this video, we're going to expand the tools that we're using and maybe write some custom tools as well. Suman, over to you. Thanks, Mike.
