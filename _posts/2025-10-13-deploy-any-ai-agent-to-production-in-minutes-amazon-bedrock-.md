So the number one conversation that I have with developers who are building agentic systems goes along the lines of this. Hi, I'm making an agent with Crew AI or Langchain or Strands agents. Now I need to get this into production. I need it to scale. I need it to be secure. And I say, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a minute. That's what AWS does best. So hold my mouse and I will show you how. So here is some agent code. It uses Strand's agents SDK and it runs just fine on my machine.
