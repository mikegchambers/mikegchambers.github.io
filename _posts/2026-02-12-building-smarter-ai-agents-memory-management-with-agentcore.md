Agents can't work without memory. Some memory might seem free inside of the agentic loop, but real systems need to manage memory over time. In this video, we're going to explore agentic memory, short-term memory, long-term memory, and how to manage both in some practical code. Imagine walking into your favorite cafe. You say hello to the barista, order a cup of tea, and the barista picks up a mug, and then stares at you. Hello. They've forgotten what they're doing, and they've forgotten what they're going to do next. Super frustrating for both of you. And agents have the same needs.
