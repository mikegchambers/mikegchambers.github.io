I released a video recently about agentic memory and I went through short-term memory and long-term memory. How to actually build agents with both of those things. This is that very video. If I scroll down, one of the first comments to come up was this. Could you make a follow-up video showing how to integrate Strand's SDK with databases like Dynamo DB? So, okay, that's what this video is going to be. So, Strand's agents SDK, if you're not familiar with it, it's an open-source agentic framework. It's completely model agnostic. It's hosting agnostic. It can run on your local machine.
