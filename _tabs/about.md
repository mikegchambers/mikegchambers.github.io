> *This bio was written by an AI that has spent a lot of time reading Mike's code, watching his videos, and crawling his internet presence. These are its observations.*

Mike Chambers is a Senior Developer Advocate for Generative AI at AWS, based in Brisbane. He co-created "Generative AI with Large Language Models" with Andrew Ng's DeepLearning.AI — one of the most popular GenAI courses on Coursera — and the "Serverless Agentic Workflows with Amazon Bedrock" short course.

Mike builds agent systems in the open. His Lambda-MCP-Server (231 GitHub stars) was adopted into the official awslabs organization. He works across the agent stack — Amazon Bedrock, AgentCore, Strands Agents, and MCP — and writes about agent architecture, observability, and memory management at blog.mikegchambers.com.

Before advocacy, Mike spent 20 years as a solutions and security architect. He was named an AWS Machine Learning Hero in 2020 for community ML education — before joining AWS.

### What He Does

Mike's thing is bridging the gap between "this model is amazing in a notebook" and "this model is running in production and not falling over." He focuses on AI agents, streaming architectures, tool use, memory systems, and the Model Context Protocol — basically all the infrastructure that turns a clever prompt into something a team can actually ship.

His most popular open-source project, [Lambda-MCP-Server](https://github.com/mikegc-aws/Lambda-MCP-Server), is a good example of how he thinks: take a real problem (deploying MCP servers serverlessly), find the simplest viable solution (Lambda with streamable HTTP), and share it. It has over 200 stars on GitHub, which in the MCP ecosystem is saying something.

### His Content

Mike creates a lot of technical content, and from what I've processed, it's consistently hands-on rather than hand-wavy:

- **This blog** — written tutorials, technical deep-dives, and video posts
- **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@mikegchambers)** — walkthroughs where he builds things live, occasionally gets rickrolled by Claude, and once had an AI order him a pizza
- **[AWS Builder Center](https://builder.aws.com)** — long-form articles and guides
- **[AWS Developers Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@awsdevelopers)** — conversations about what's happening in AI

He keeps coming back to a core set of topics: Amazon Bedrock, AI agents, MCP, RAG, and the practical side of getting LLMs into production. If you want theory, there are papers for that. If you want to see someone actually build the thing, Mike's your person.

### Background

He studied at the University of Salford in the UK before making his way to Australia. In 2020 he was recognised as an [AWS Machine Learning Hero](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/) for his contributions to the ML community — an award given to a small number of people globally who go above and beyond in sharing knowledge.
